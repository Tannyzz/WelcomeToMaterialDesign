        At Google we say, “Focus on the user and all else will follow.”
        We embrace that principle in our design by seeking to build experiences that surprise
        and enlighten our users in equal measure. This site is for exploring how we go about it.
        You can read our design guidelines, download assets and resources, meet our team,
        and learn about job and training opportunities.
